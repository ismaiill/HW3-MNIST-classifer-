# MNIST Digit Classification with PyTorch

This project implements a CNN from scratch and uses the MNIST dataset and PyTorch to classify digits.

## Key Features:

- Implementation of three neural network models:
  - Fully Connected Network (fcNet)
  - Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet)
  - Custom Network (Net)
- Data loading and preprocessing using PyTorch's datasets and transforms
- Training loop implementation with customizable hyperparameters
- Model evaluation and performance metrics calculation
- Visualization of training progress and results
